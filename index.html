      <b>Progress:</b> I explored the different datasets on data.gov.sg (used this website as data was complete and reliable) to see what issue I could possibly work on. <br>
      I then arrived at the conclusion that I would like to work on the issue of cost of living in Singapore. <br>
      I broke down the issue into the different factors that I can visualise with data. First, I started from the core issue, inflation, as it is the core reason for the rising cost of living. <br>
      To monitor inflation, I decided to use data of change in CPI over the past few years, from data.gov.sg. Then I went on to the next factor, income, which is what Singaporeans rely on to manage their expenditures. <br>
      I then decided to use to go abit further to analyse what this household income is being spent on, to compare it with the inflation. <br>
      Finally, I thought it would be good to compare all this data with the support that the government has been providing Singaporeans with to cope with the rising cost of living and whether this support is effective. <br>

It has faced a consistently high cost of living which has been further worsened due to the high inflation. Prices haven risen by 8.1% in local-currency terms, which is the highest rate in 20 years. The high cost of living has even become a significant source of mental health worries among Singaporeans. <br><br> 
            The government has been rolling out various support measures in the form of assurance packages to help cushion the effects of this rising cost of living. <br><br>
            I would like to analyse what are the factors contributing to this rising cost of living and whether Singaporeans are able to cope with this rising cost of living in terms of income, government assurance packages and long-term finances.

    <b>Progress:</b>
    I continued to work on my CSS and HTML codes for this week and did not do much with my js code as I wanted to finalise my layout before getting the charts out. 
    I worked on feedback regarding my colour scheme and changed some of the colours which did not have proper contrast and made the words hard to see, by using online colour palettes and experimenting with various colours until I found a colour combination that was good enough. 
    I encountered various errors with the layout part, mainly because of the flex layout as I was still quite unfamiliar with how the flexbox layout worked.
    My boxes were being weirdly sized and kept going out of the page or over the border I had set. I did some research on flexbox layout before I continued working on my flexbox layout. 
    I also faced some issues with formatting my table as I did not know how to insert a row that runs over various columns, which I eventually also figured out how to do using w3schools.

      <h4><u>Week 12 Diary Entry</u></h4>
      <p>
        <b>Progress:</b>
        While working on my charts for the inflation rate and income growth rate comparison section, I decided that maybe I should expand my dataset beyond the 4th and 5th decile, to all deciles instead as 4th and 5th decile seemed like too little data when I actually got the chart out.
        Hence, I broke down the deciles into high income and low income groups to possibly see if theres any other trends I can talk about so my data analysis can be deeper.
        I decided to add in onclick functions such that when the user clicks high-income, the graphs for high income will appear and when the user clicks low-income, the graphs for low-income will appear.
        I ended up facing quite a few issues because of this, as I had to reconstruct the function. I kept running into errors in my functions where my chart would not appear at all.
        So, I decided to organise my html code first, according to the different sections, so that I can see what id and class is under which section, which then helped me to fix my js code since I could see which ids where wrongly linked. 
        I also faced some issues with styling as I kept encountering white spaces between divs, which I then managed to fix with margin based on research online.
